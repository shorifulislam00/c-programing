ken thompson work in google and develop go language at 2003/2004

all operation system developed in c language

why learn c ?

2. help us to think as computer scientist rather than software engineer

source code => compiler => compiling => machine code

what is text editor ?
microsoft office is text processing software.
notepad is just only text editing software.

IDE => Integrated Development Environment

download and install codeblock IDE.

download MinGW for windows. install it and open it.

this is MinGW package installer. select basic from left panel. and select all package of basic by right click on package and select mark. then apply the changes from installation menu.

after install this into C:\MinGW, go to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat

this is gcc commnad line.

open windows environment settings, edit PATH variable. add new location to PATH, "C:\MinGW\bin"

now open cmd and type "gcc -v" for checking is that gcc installation success / fail.

for text editing we use visual code studio IDE.

visual studio extension: c\c++, code runner

install git bash command line.

terminal: cmd, powersheel, cmder

[part-2]
hello world program

c programming language extension .c

There have two way to run c program.

1. compiling
2. executing

compiling
------------
compile and make binary file
gcc hello.c -o hello

run the binary file
./hello.exe

output
Hello World

success!!!

steps of running code
---------------------
1. Editing / Writting
2. Compiling
3. Linking
4. Executing

C programming code structure / skeleton
-----------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>  -> header file

int main()  -> main function
{
    return 0;   -> return output
}

Explanation of code
-------------------
header file
stdio -> Standard Input Output

#include -> header file / system file including.

\n -> new line
\t -> tab

===================

mother of all programming language

1972/1973 invented

bel lab

dennies ritchie

ken thompson developer of unix

ken thompson develop B language and c language come from b language.

ken thompson work in google and develop go language at 2003/2004

all operation system developed in c language

why learn c ?
=============
1. pillar of all language
2. help us to think as computer scientist rather than software engineer
3. simple easy and understandable
4. low memory, big project

syntax, philosophy

pointer, memory management, file system, bits

object based programming OOP

workplace
environment

compiler
text editor / IDE
terminal
browser

github

what is compiler ?
compiler is like translator.
computer software / tools.

machine level language
high level language

============================

============================

source code => compiler => compiling => machine code

what is text editor ?
microsoft office is text processing software.
notepad is just only text editing software.

IDE => Integrated Development Environment

download and install codeblock IDE.

download MinGW for windows. install it and open it.

this is MinGW package installer. select basic from left panel. and select all package of basic by right click on package and select mark. then apply the changes from installation menu.

after install this into C:\MinGW, go to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat

this is gcc commnad line.

open windows environment settings, edit PATH variable. add new location to PATH, "C:\MinGW\bin"

now open cmd and type "gcc -v" for checking is that gcc installation success / fail.

for text editing we use visual code studio IDE.

visual studio extension: c\c++, code runner

install git bash command line.

terminal: cmd, powersheel, cmder

[part-2]
hello world program

c programming language extension .c

There have two way to run c program.

1. compiling
2. executing

compiling
------------
compile and make binary file
gcc hello.c -o hello

run the binary file
./hello.exe

output
Hello World

success!!!

steps of running code
---------------------
1. Editing / Writting
2. Compiling
3. Linking
4. Executing

C programming code structure / skeleton
-----------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>  -> header file

int main()  -> main function
{
    return 0;   -> return output
}

Explanation of code
-------------------
header file
stdio -> Standard Input Output

#include -> header file / system file including.

\n -> new line
\t -> tab

===================

-------------------
scap character. like: \n, \t

printf() function a single quotes not working. double quotes required.

/ -> forward slash
\ -> back slash

what is variable ?
a variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate.

reuseable data
duplicate value in code

we don't work with raw data.

variable is just a container to contain our data.

---------------------

---------------------
C is a statically typed programming language.

declaration of variable in c
DataType variable name = value

integer number is just general number

variable also known as identifier.

operator (+, -, *, /)

second brack is curly braces.

- scope
-- local variable
--- under any function

-- global variable
--- outer side of function

- memory life time
-- static
-- automatic

- External Variable

- Define
-- allowcate memory location
-- use one time

- Declare
-- give/assign value to variable
-- use multiple times

Data type

- Number
--- Integer -- 145
--- Float -- 78.25f
    in floating point number declaration its good to use 'f' / 'F' after value.

--- Short
--- Double
--- Long


- Text
--- Character -- 'a', 'b', 'c'
--- can store only one character. if given string it throw an error and store last character of string.


- Boolean
- Custom Type

C is a case sensitive language.

C language a boolean bolte kono data type nai.

header file add kore boolean type data use korte hobe.

---------------------

---------------------
vairable is cholok.
constant is static. not changable

declare constat variable

1. #define PI 3.1416 [#define CONSTANT_NAME VALUE]
2. const float PI = 3.1416f;

constant variable written in capital letter and others in lower case.

reserved words -> in C language there have 32 keywords / reserved words

reserved words can't use as variable.

[22-11-20]
scanf lession

library -> stdio.h -> print scan function

multiple variable declaration in short way: int a, b; if same data type.

scanf -> take input from user

single value receive
--------------------
scanf("%d", &a);

multiple value receive
----------------------
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
